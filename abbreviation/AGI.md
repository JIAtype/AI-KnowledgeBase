| Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) refers to the hypothetical intelligence of a machine that can perform any intellectual task that a human being can. It's a type of AI that aims to replicate the full range of human cognitive abilities, including learning, reasoning, and problem-solving, across a wide range of domains. Unlike current AI systems, which are designed for specific tasks, AGI would be able to adapt to new and unfamiliar situations without needing to be explicitly programmed for each task. | 通用人工智能 (AGI) 是指机器能够执行人类所能完成的任何智力任务的假设性智能。它是一种旨在复制人类认知能力（包括学习、推理和解决问题）的人工智能，涵盖广泛领域。与目前专为特定任务而设计的人工智能系统不同，AGI 能够适应新的和不熟悉的情况，而无需针对每项任务进行明确的编程。 |  |
| Human-Level Intelligence:
AGI is envisioned as a system that can perform at least as well as a human on a wide variety of cognitive tasks.  | 人类水平的智能：
AGI 被设想为一个能够在各种认知任务上至少与人类表现相当的系统。 |  |
| Generalization:
AGI would possess the ability to generalize knowledge and skills learned in one area to new and unfamiliar areas.  | 泛化能力：
AGI 能够将在一个领域学到的知识和技能推广到新的和不熟悉的领域。 |  |
| Adaptability:
AGI would be able to adapt to new situations and problems without needing to be specifically programmed for each one.  | 适应性：
AGI 能够适应新的情况和问题，而无需针对每个情况和问题进行专门的编程。 |  |
| Beyond Narrow AI:
Current AI systems are typically designed for specific tasks, like playing chess or recognizing faces. AGI would be capable of handling a much broader range of tasks and learning new ones.  | 超越狭义人工智能：
目前的人工智能系统通常针对特定任务而设计，例如下棋或人脸识别。 AGI 将能够处理更广泛的任务并学习新任务。 |  |
| Theoretical Concept:
AGI is currently a theoretical concept, and its development is a major goal of AI research.  | 理论概念：
AGI 目前是一个理论概念，其发展是人工智能研究的主要目标。 |  |
| Interdisciplinary Field:
Developing AGI involves collaboration between computer science, neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and other fields.  | 跨学科领域：
开发 AGI 需要计算机科学、神经科学、认知心理学和其他领域的合作。 |  |
