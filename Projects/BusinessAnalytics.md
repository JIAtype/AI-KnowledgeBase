Shopping Mall Consumer Analytics and Prediction 

My goal here was to analyze mall sales data and come up with strategies to boost revenue.  
I developed a smart analytics platform that identifies high-value customers, segments users, and predicts behavior.  
Some highlights included: tracking the link between new members and overall revenue, detecting special cases and outliers, K-means clustering for customer grouping, decision tree models for VIP clients, product recommendations based on user records, and inventory recommendations by brand.  
The results were all shown in an interactive Plotly dashboard, making the insights clear and actionable.
