Shopping Mall Consumer Analytics and Prediction 

My goal here was to analyze mall sales data and come up with strategies to boost revenue.  
I developed a smart analytics platform that identifies high-value customers, segments users, and predicts behavior.  
Some highlights included: tracking the link between new members and overall revenue, detecting special cases and outliers, K-means clustering for customer grouping, decision tree models for VIP clients, product recommendations based on user records, and inventory recommendations by brand.  
The results were all shown in an interactive Plotly dashboard, making the insights clear and actionable.

**Shopping Mall Consumer Analytics and Prediction**

The aim of my project was to analyze shopping mall sales data and develop practical strategies for increasing overall revenue.  
To do this, I built a smart analytics platform capable of identifying high-value customers, segmenting the user base, and predicting consumer behavior.

- At the core of the platform is an innovative application of the Dynamic Window Algorithm (DWA). This method effectively processes time series data, allowing us to track how new member sign-ups correlate with overall revenue trends.
- The system automatically detects and highlights revenue peaks for the mall, making it easy to identify periods of strong performance.
- Additionally, I implemented advanced data analysis and visualization tools to quickly spot anomalies and special cases within the sales data.
- Finally, by applying K-Means clustering to RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) data, I was able to categorize and segment customers into distinct groups. This gives us deep insights into diverse consumer behaviors and helps tailor marketing strategies accordingly.
